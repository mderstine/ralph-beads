# Ralph-Beads

A unified framework for autonomous AI development combining Geoffrey Huntley's
[Ralph Loop](https://ghuntley.com/loop/) methodology with
[Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) dependency-aware issue tracking.

## What This Is

Ralph-Beads is a protocol for letting an AI agent build your software autonomously
while you direct it from the outside. You write **what** you want (specs). The
framework handles **how** to break it down, order it, and execute it — one task
at a time, in an infinite loop, with fresh context every iteration.

Your role shifts from writing code to writing requirements, watching the loop,
and tuning when it drifts.

## How It Works

Two concepts combine:

**The Ralph Loop** runs Claude Code in a bash `while` loop. Each iteration gets
fresh context (no hallucination buildup), implements one task, commits, and exits.
The loop restarts for the next task.

**Beads** (`bd`) replaces the original Ralph Loop's flat `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
with a proper dependency graph. Tasks know what blocks them. The agent only works
on unblocked tasks. Discovered work gets linked back to its origin.

```
You write specs ──► Plan mode creates task graph ──► Build mode implements tasks
                         (bd issues)                    (one per loop iteration)
```

| Ralph Loop (original) | Ralph-Beads (this framework) |
|----------------------|------------------------------|
| `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` flat list | `bd` dependency graph (DAG) |
| LLM picks next task by reading markdown | `bd ready` returns unblocked work |
| No blocker awareness | `blocks` dependencies prevent premature work |
| Manual task discovery | `discovered-from` links capture emergent work |
| Single agent only | `--claim` enables multi-agent coordination |
| Plan drift requires regeneration | Graph stays accurate via atomic updates |

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI — `claude`
- [Beads](https://github.com/steveyegge/beads) CLI — `npm install -g @beads/bd`
- [Dolt](https://github.com/dolthub/dolt) — version-controlled SQL database
- Python 3.12+ (or adapt `AGENTS.md` for your stack)

## Getting Started

### 1. Install

```bash
git clone <this-repo>
cd ralph-beads

npm install -g @beads/bd
bd init --prefix myproject
```

### 2. Write Your Specs

Specs go in `specs/`, one file per **topic of concern**. A topic of concern is a
distinct aspect of your project that you can describe in one sentence without using
"and". If you need "and", split it into two specs.

```bash
cat > specs/auth.md << 'EOF'
# Authentication

## Job To Be Done
Users need to sign in with email/password and receive a JWT token.

## Requirements
- POST /auth/login accepts email + password, returns JWT
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Invalid credentials return 401
- Passwords are hashed with bcrypt before storage
EOF
```

```bash
cat > specs/user-profile.md << 'EOF'
# User Profile

## Job To Be Done
Authenticated users need to view and update their profile information.

## Requirements
- GET /users/me returns the current user's profile
- PATCH /users/me updates allowed fields (name, avatar)
- Profile changes require valid JWT in Authorization header
EOF
```

**Tips for writing good specs:**
- Be specific about inputs, outputs, and error cases
- Include technical constraints (database, framework, API format)
- State acceptance criteria — how will you know it's done?
- Don't prescribe implementation — say what, not how

### 3. Configure Your Stack

Edit `AGENTS.md` to match your project's build/test/lint commands. This file is
loaded every iteration, so the agent always knows how to validate its work:

```bash
# AGENTS.md — Build & Validate section

# Node.js example
npm test && npm run lint && npm run build

# Rust example
cargo test && cargo clippy && cargo build

# Go example
go test ./... && golangci-lint run
```

Also update the validation commands in `PROMPT_build.md` Phase 3 to match.

### 4. Run the Planning Loop

```bash
./loop.sh plan
```

This reads your specs and creates a dependency-aware task graph in beads. After it
runs, inspect the results:

```bash
bd list --status open     # See all created issues
bd ready                  # See what's unblocked and ready to build
bd dep tree <epic-id>     # Visualize dependency structure
```

**If the plan doesn't look right**, edit your specs and run `./loop.sh plan` again.
Planning iterations are cheap — the agent doesn't write code in this mode.

### 5. Run the Build Loop

```bash
./loop.sh
```

The agent will:
1. Query `bd ready` for the highest-priority unblocked task
2. Claim it (atomic — prevents conflicts)
3. Implement the work
4. Run your test/lint/build validation
5. Commit only if validation passes
6. Close the issue with context
7. Exit — loop restarts with fresh context for the next task

**It stops automatically when:** no ready work remains (all done or all blocked).

## How You Direct It

You are the director, not the coder. Here's how you steer:

### Before the Loop

| What you control | How |
|-----------------|-----|
| **What gets built** | Write specs in `specs/` |
| **Build order** | Beads dependencies (set during planning) |
| **Quality gates** | Test/lint/build commands in `AGENTS.md` |
| **Coding standards** | Patterns and constraints in `AGENTS.md` |
| **Agent behavior** | Instructions in `PROMPT_plan.md` / `PROMPT_build.md` |

### During the Loop

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Watch progress** | `bd list --status open` / `bd ready` |
| **Pause the loop** | `Ctrl+C` between iterations |
| **Skip a stuck task** | `bd close <id> --reason "skipped"` and restart |
| **Add urgent work** | `bd create "Hotfix: ..." -p 0 -t bug` |
| **Re-prioritize** | `bd update <id> --priority 0` |
| **Block something** | `bd dep add <task-id> <blocker-id> --type blocks` |
| **Check what's next** | `bd ready --json` |
| **View full state** | `bd prime` |
| **View iteration logs** | `cat /tmp/ralph-beads-iter-<N>.log` |

### After the Loop

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Review what was built** | `git log --oneline` |
| **Check remaining work** | `bd list --status open` |
| **Find what's blocked** | `bd list --status open` then `bd dep tree <id>` |
| **Add more specs** | Write new `specs/*.md`, run `./loop.sh plan` again |
| **Re-plan from scratch** | Close all issues, write new specs, re-plan |

### Tuning the Agent's Behavior

The framework gives you four "knobs" to turn:

**1. Specs** (`specs/*.md`) — Control *what* gets built. More detailed specs produce
more focused tasks. Vague specs produce vague implementations.

**2. AGENTS.md** — Control *how* the agent works. Add coding standards, known
gotchas, framework-specific patterns. This file accumulates learnings over time.
When the agent makes a mistake, add a note here so it doesn't repeat it.

**3. Prompt files** (`PROMPT_plan.md`, `PROMPT_build.md`) — Control the agent's
*process*. You rarely need to change these, but you can add guardrails (in the
numbered 999+ sections) or adjust phase instructions.

**4. Backpressure** (tests, lint, types) — Control *quality*. The agent cannot commit
code that fails validation. Stronger test suites produce more reliable output.
Write tests manually if needed to raise the quality bar.

### When Things Go Wrong

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Agent implements the wrong thing | Improve the spec, re-plan |
| Agent keeps failing validation | Check `AGENTS.md` for missing patterns |
| Agent goes in circles | `Ctrl+C`, check the iteration log, add a guardrail to `AGENTS.md` |
| Task graph has wrong ordering | `bd dep add/remove` to fix dependencies |
| Agent works on low-priority stuff | `bd update <id> --priority 0` on the important task |
| Agent discovers too much side work | Add "minimize discovered issues" to `PROMPT_build.md` |
| Plan is stale | Re-run `./loop.sh plan` (cheap — no code changes) |

```

**Why this works:**
- **Fresh context** each iteration prevents hallucination accumulation
- **Deterministic task selection** via `bd ready` — not LLM guesswork
- **Backpressure** (tests/lint) forces correctness before commits
- **Git-backed state** survives context resets and machine restarts
- **Dependency graph** ensures work happens in the right order

                              │

         ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
         │         DOWNSTREAM (backpressure)        │
         │                                          │
         │  tests     →  correctness                │
         │  linter    →  style compliance            │
         │  types     →  type safety                │
         │  bd ready  →  dependency ordering         │
         └─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

You push intent **downstream** through specs and standards.
Quality gates push **back upstream** by rejecting bad implementations.
The agent lives in the middle, squeezed into producing correct code.

## Multi-Agent Setup

Run multiple agents in parallel. Beads prevents conflicts via atomic claiming:

```bash
# Terminal 1
BD_ACTOR=agent-1 ./loop.sh

# Terminal 2
BD_ACTOR=agent-2 ./loop.sh
```

Each agent will claim different tasks. If agent-1 claims task A, agent-2 skips it
and picks the next ready task.

## VS Code Copilot Agent Integration

If you use GitHub Copilot in VS Code, this repo includes agent definitions and
skills that encode the ralph-beads workflow natively in agent mode — no `loop.sh`
required.

### Prerequisites

- VS Code 1.108.2+ with GitHub Copilot extension
- `bd` CLI on your PATH (verified in the agent's shell environment)
- `.vscode/settings.json` configured for agent mode (included)

### Agents

| Agent | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `beads-pm` | `.github/agents/beads-pm.agent.md` | Planning loop: specs → beads task graph |
| `beads-dev` | `.github/agents/beads-dev.agent.md` | Build loop: claim → implement → validate → commit → close |

Use `@beads-pm` to convert specs into a dependency-ordered task graph.
Use `@beads-dev` to implement the next ready task (one per invocation).

### Skills

| Skill | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `/beads-triage` | `.github/skills/beads-triage/SKILL.md` | Assess and classify new work |
| `/beads-create` | `.github/skills/beads-create/SKILL.md` | Create issues with duplicate checking |
| `/beads-workflow` | `.github/skills/beads-workflow/SKILL.md` | Full claim-implement-close cycle |

### How the Loop Maps to Agent Mode

The Ralph Loop (`while :; do claude -p; done`) becomes **repeated agent invocations**:

| Ralph Loop | VS Code Agent Mode |
|------------|-------------------|
| `loop.sh` iterates automatically | You invoke `@beads-dev` per task |
| Fresh context each iteration | Agent mode provides session isolation |
| `bd ready` picks next task | `@beads-dev` calls `bd ready` itself |
| One-task-per-iteration discipline | Enforced by `beads-dev` agent rules |

**Typical workflow:**

```
1. Write specs in specs/
2. @beads-pm — creates task graph from specs
3. @beads-dev — implements one task, commits, closes
4. Repeat step 3 until bd ready returns empty
```

### File Convention Mapping

Every Claude Code convention file has a VS Code Copilot equivalent:

| Claude Code | VS Code Copilot | Purpose |
|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | IDE-wide project instructions, injected into every session |
| `AGENTS.md` | `.github/instructions/beads-conventions.instructions.md` | Always-on conventions: bd CLI, commit format, coding standards |
| `PROMPT_plan.md` | `.github/agents/beads-pm.agent.md` | Planning agent: specs → dependency-aware task graph |
| `PROMPT_build.md` | `.github/agents/beads-dev.agent.md` | Build agent: claim → implement → validate → commit → close |
| `.claude/commands/*.md` | `.github/prompts/*.prompt.md` | Slash command / prompt file definitions |
| `.claude/skills/` | `.github/skills/*/SKILL.md` | Reusable skill definitions |

The dual-file structure lets the framework run identically from both IDEs. `bd` is the
shared state layer — it doesn't care which IDE invoked the agent.

### Instruction Files

`.github/instructions/beads-conventions.instructions.md` is auto-applied to all
files and encodes bd CLI conventions, commit format, and coding standards.
`.github/copilot-instructions.md` injects the ralph-beads protocol into every
Copilot chat session.

## Adapting for Non-Python Projects

1. Update `AGENTS.md` Build & Validate section with your commands
2. Update `PROMPT_build.md` Phase 3 with the same commands
3. Replace `src/` and `tests/` with your project's structure
4. Update `pyproject.toml` or replace with your package manager config

## Concepts & Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Ralph Loop** | Bash `while` loop feeding prompts to Claude Code |
| **Beads** | Git-backed dependency-aware issue tracker (`bd` CLI) |
| **Spec** | Requirements document in `specs/` — one per topic of concern |
| **Topic of concern** | A distinct project aspect describable in one sentence |
| **Backpressure** | Tests/lint/types that reject bad code before commit |
| **Upstream steering** | Specs, AGENTS.md, prompts — what you write to direct the agent |
| **Downstream steering** | Validation gates that force quality |
| **Discovered work** | Issues the agent finds mid-implementation and files for later |
| **Ready work** | Issues with no unresolved blockers (`bd ready`) |
| **Claiming** | Atomic lock on an issue to prevent multi-agent conflicts |
